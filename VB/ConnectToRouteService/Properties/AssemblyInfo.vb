' How to calculate a route between waypoints and customize the appearance of a route path using a Microsoft Bing Route web service
' 
' This example demonstrates how to calculate a route between several waypoints and
' change the appearance of a route path by means of the Microsoft Bing Route web
' service.
' 
' To calculate a route between waypoints, call the
' BingRouteDataProvider.CalculateRoute
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapBingRouteDataProvider_CalculateRoutetopic)
' method and pass a list of waypoints as its argument.
' 
' To customize the route
' path appearance, do the following:
' 
' - Handle the
' BingRouteDataProvider.RouteCalculated event;
' - Access the route path using the
' RouteCalculationResult
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraMapRouteCalculationResulttopic)
' object inside the BingRouteDataProvider.RouteCalculated event handler's
' BingRouteCalculatedEventArgs
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraMapBingRouteCalculatedEventArgstopic);
' -
' Create a MapPolyline
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraMapMapPolylinetopic)
' with calculated route points. To access the route points collection, use the
' BingRouteResult.RoutePath
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapBingRouteResult_RoutePathtopic)
' property;
' - Customize the stroke and stroke width of the map polyline using the
' MapItem.Stroke
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapMapItem_Stroketopic)
' and MapItem.StrokeWidth
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapMapItem_StrokeWidthtopic)
' properties. The map pushpins are generated automatically at each route waypoint
' position because the InformationDataProviderBase.GenerateLayerItems
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapInformationDataProviderBase_GenerateLayerItemstopic)
' property is set to true by default. Note that the pushpins' text contains an
' empty string. To number route waypoints (from start to finish) in the pushpin,
' handle the InformationDataProviderBase.LayerItemsGenerating
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapInformationDataProviderBase_LayerItemsGeneratingtopic)
' event and modify the MapPointer.Text
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapMapPointer_Texttopic)
' property. Note that if you run this sample as is, you will get a warning message
' saying that the specified Bing Maps key is invalid. To learn more about Bing Map
' keys, please refer to the How to: Get a Bing Maps Key
' (http://help.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument15102) tutorial.
